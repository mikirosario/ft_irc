**			seem to have some semi-unstandardized uses too, such as using the

**			If there are not four parameters (five arguments in the argument
**			vector, including the command argument), an ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS error
**			reply is returned to @a sender.

**			regarding the user parameter, an ERR_UNKNOWNERROR error reply is
**			returned to @a sender explaining the problem.
**
**			If @a sender is unregistered but has already provided a username
